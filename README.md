[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) application boilerplate based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/), [React Transform HMR](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) for rapid application development.

## Install

* **Note: requires a node version >= 7 and an npm version >= 4.**
* **If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [our debugging guide](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate.git your-project-name
```

And then install dependencies with yarn.

```bash
$ cd your-project-name
$ yarn
```
**Note**: If you can't use [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn), run `npm install`.

## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Alternatively, you can run the renderer and main processes separately. This way, you can restart one process without waiting for the other. Run these two commands **simultaneously** in different console tabs:

```bash
$ npm run start-renderer-dev
$ npm run start-main-dev
```

## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ npm run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies.

Then,
```bash
$ npm run package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ npm run package -- --[option]
```

<!-- To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run test-e2e
``` -->

:bulb: You can debug your production build with devtools by simply setting the `DEBUG_PROD` env variable:
```bash
DEBUG_PROD=true npm run package
```

## Static Type Checking
This project comes with Flow support out of the box! You can annotate your code with types, [get Flow errors as ESLint errors](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors), and get [type errors during runtime](https://github.com/codemix/flow-runtime) during development. Types are completely optional.
